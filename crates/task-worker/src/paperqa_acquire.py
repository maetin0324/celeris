"""Runner embedded in the celeris `paperqa` adapter (ADR-0035 D1 / D5).

Before PaperQA2 can answer anything it needs papers. This runner is the
"go and find the papers" stage:

  0. **the search terms are written by the LLM** (ADR-0035 D5, Phase 36).
     One `chat/completions` call to the same OpenAI-compatible endpoint
     PaperQA2 itself uses (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`), asking for 3-6 English
     queries plus the terms that mark an off-topic paper. If anything
     about that answer is broken, the deterministic terms the adapter
     extracted (`queries` in the input) are used instead and the
     fallback is announced on `progress:`.
  1. search arXiv (restricted to the arXiv categories the LLM named) and
     OpenAlex (restricted to open access and to the Computer Science
     field), collect the candidates, throw away the ones whose title or
     abstract contains one of the exclude terms,
  2. download the open-access PDFs into the project's corpus directory.

Contract with the adapter (crates/task-worker/src/paperqa.rs):
  argv[1]            path to a JSON file (see INPUT below)
  --fixture <dir>    tests only: read canned responses from <dir> instead
                     of the network (no HTTP request is made at all)
  stdout             one message per line: "progress: <text>" while
                     running, and exactly one final line
                     "CELERIS_ACQUIRE {"candidates": n, "pdfs": m, "abstracts": k,
                                     "engines": {"arxiv": a, "openalex": b},

                                     "query_source": "llm"|"fallback"}"
  exit               0 on success, non-zero on failure (short message on
                     stderr). The adapter keeps going either way: the
                     evidence gate (ADR-0035 D3) decides.

                 {"url": "https://example.org/paper.pdf", "kind": "pdf"}]}

ADR-0063 D1 (Phase 109): when a candidate's PDF cannot be fetched (403, not a
PDF, no URL at all), and `abstract_fallback` is on (the default), its abstract
is written as a plain-text document (`<key>_abstract.txt`) into the corpus
instead, so PaperQA2 can still cite it -- clearly marked as "full text could
not be retrieved". Before giving up, an open-access PDF is also looked for via
Unpaywall and Semantic Scholar (`find_oa_pdf`) using the candidate's DOI. Seed
URLs (PDF / DOI / arXiv links pulled by the adapter out of the task's
objective/inputs) are turned into extra candidates (`candidate_from_seed`) and
merged in ahead of the search results, so they are never dropped by
`max_candidates` and always attempted first.

ADR-0063 Phase 109b A1 (production burst of `openalex search failed for
'...': HTTP Error 429`): OpenAlex, Unpaywall and Semantic Scholar all go
through one shared `RateLimiter` (at most 1 request/sec) and a 429 is
retried up to 2 more times, honoring `Retry-After` when sent (else 2s / 4s /
8s). Every OpenAlex request always carries `mailto` (falling back to
`DEFAULT_CONTACT_EMAIL`), landing it in the polite pool even when no
operator-configured address is set. Unpaywall/Semantic Scholar are only
queried for candidates that still have no `pdf_url` (never repeated once one
is found), which keeps the extra request volume down.

                    "error": "<why we fell back>"}
  papers.json      [{title, authors[], year, venue, doi, arxiv_id, url,

                     query_text, abstract, abstract_only}]
  sources.json     [{url, title, engine, cited}]  -- same shape as the
                   LDR runner writes (ADR-0031 D1). `cited` is always
                   false here; the adapter fills it in after `pqa`
                   answers (ADR-0035 D2), because only then is there an
                   answer to match against.

Everything after step 0 is mechanical: the exclusion, the de-duplication
and the ordering of the candidates ("relevance", round-robin across the
(query, engine) result lists so that no single query crowds the list out)
involve no LLM at all.

Only the standard library is used, and every network call goes through
`Fetcher.get`/`Fetcher.post`, so the module can be imported on its own
(e.g. to unit test `normalize_title`, `arxiv_url` or `parse_query_plan`)
and can run end to end against a fixture directory without touching the
network.

- Never use a project or product name on its own (for example "Pluvio"): outside this project
  nobody indexes that word. Either pair it with the words that say what it is, or drop it.
- An ambiguous word must carry its field. "ad hoc" on its own finds mobile ad hoc networks, so
  write "ad hoc file system HPC". "runtime" on its own finds programming language runtimes, so
  write "asynchronous I/O runtime storage".
- "engines" lists which of "arxiv" and "openalex" to search for that query (use both unless one
  of them is clearly wrong for it).
- "arxiv_categories" lists the arXiv categories the query should be restricted to, for example
  ["cs.DC","cs.OS","cs.PF"].
