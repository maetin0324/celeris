"""Runner embedded in the celeris `paperqa` adapter (ADR-0063 Phase 109d C1).

Replaces the `pqa ask` CLI (Phase 108/109/109b/109c) with the PaperQA2
**Python API** (`paperqa.ask`/`paperqa.Settings`), confirmed against the
production venv (`paperqa==2026.8.12`) by the parent agent (2026-09-23):

  paperqa.agents.ask(query: str, settings: Settings) -> AnswerResponse
  AnswerResponse.session -> PQASession(id, question, answer, raw_answer,
      answer_reasoning, has_successful_answer, context, contexts,
      references, formatted_answer, graded_answer, cost, token_counts,
      config_md5, tool_history)
  PQASession.contexts -> list[Context(id, context, question, text, score)]
  Context.text -> Text(embedding, text, name, media, doc)
  Text.doc -> Doc(embedding, docname, dockey, citation, content_hash, ...)
  Settings.from_name(name) reads `pqa_directory("settings")/<name>.json`, an
      **unconfigurable** `~/.pqa/settings/` path -- `PQA_SETTINGS_DIR` has no
      effect on it (confirmed by reading the production venv's source,
      paperqa==2026.8.12: `pqa_directory` never looks at that env var).
      ADR-0063 Phase 109e: this runner reads `settings_path` (a full path
      the adapter builds from `[adapters.paperqa] settings`) directly
      instead, redoing the same "validate then rebuild" two steps
      `from_name` itself does, and only falls back to `from_name(name)` when
      `settings_path` does not exist (still the only way to reach paperqa's
      own bundled config names, e.g. `"high_quality"`).

Why the switch (ADR-0063 Phase 109b A2 / Phase 109c P-109c-1): the CLI has no
`--output json`, so the adapter had to scrape the `References`/`Sources`
section out of the CLI's rich-formatted console text. That is a lossy proxy
for the evidence PaperQA2 actually used. The Python API hands back
`PQASession.contexts` directly -- the adapter now counts a candidate as
`cited` if any context's `docname`/`dockey` matches it (a citation from the
evidence the model actually retrieved), OR-ed with the old text-match against
the answer body (`answer_cites`, unchanged, still counts as auxiliary).

Contract with the adapter (crates/task-worker/src/paperqa.rs):
  argv[1]  path to a JSON file (see INPUT below)
  stdout   "progress: <text>" lines while running (no marker line -- the
           adapter reads the result straight from `output_path` once this
           process exits)
  exit     0 on success (an `output_path` JSON is always written, even if
           individual questions failed -- see `error` per answer),
           2 bad usage, or settings could not be resolved (ADR-0063 Phase
           109e: neither `settings_path` nor `Settings.from_name` found
           anything -- retrying will not help, the adapter reports this as
           `retryable: false`), **3 if `paperqa` cannot be imported** (the
           adapter turns this into a clear "tool not set up" error rather
           than a generic retryable failure), 1 any other failure before any
           question could be attempted.

`questions` (the `[{id, target, question}]` list `ask()` is actually called
with, one per target plus one optional comparison summary -- ADR-0063 Phase
109d C3) is *derived* from the fields above by `build_questions_for_targets`,
not supplied by the adapter: that keeps the one prompt template that
production observation (Phase 109c) showed actually gets a structured answer
in a single place, testable on its own (`python3 -c`, no `paperqa` install
needed) rather than duplicated on the Rust side.

OUTPUT (`output_path`):

                                                    # question could still run (`[]` otherwise)
   "comparison_page": "projects/benchfs/architecture-overview.md" | null,  # Phase 109h
   "comparison_context_chars": 3001 }              # Phase 109h: 0 when no context was used
  (or, if `paperqa` is not importable: {"error": "...", "answers": []})

Retries (ADR-0063 Phase 109d C1): each `ask()` call is retried up to 3 times
(2s / 4s / 8s backoff) on a transient failure (503 / 502 / 429 / connection
reset-refused-aborted / timeout -- the same llm-proxy failure modes ADR-0063
Phase 109b already retries for LDR and the litellm `num_retries` setting
already retries for PaperQA2's own internal calls). A question that still
fails is recorded with `"error"` set and an empty answer/contexts -- it does
not abort the other questions or the run.

Only the standard library is used outside of the guarded `import paperqa`,
so `build_questions_for_targets`/`build_target_aspect_table`/
`flatten_contexts` (and the retry helpers) can be exercised with
`python3 -c` against plain dicts, without the `paperqa` package installed
(ADR-0063 Phase 109d test requirement).

ADR-0063 Phase 109g A: the comparison-classification summary question (the last one in
`build_questions_for_targets`'s output when `comparison_target` is given) is a *placeholder*
at that point -- `main()` resolves the compare target's design conditions
(`load_comparison_design_context`, from a matching knowledge-base page or, failing that, the
objective's own surrounding sentence) and, once the per-target answers are in, rebuilds it as
a forced judgement question (`build_comparison_question`) that must classify each target
`公平比較可能`/`背景比較のみ` against those design conditions -- a lack of literature
mentioning the compare target is explicitly not an acceptable reason to answer 未確認. Only
when no design-conditions text can be found at all does the old, permissive question stay in
place (未確認 remains acceptable then). `build_target_aspect_table`'s comparison column is
then read back out of that summary answer (`extract_comparison_classification`), not out of
each target's own per-target answer.

ADR-0063 Phase 109h: Phase 109g's own production run (`01M37FZRX8GMST4SVDNNQF8NMV`, 8 targets +
the summary question = 9 > the then-default `max_asks = 8`) still dropped the summary question
entirely for budget, before `main()` ever got a chance to rebuild it as the judgement question --
`report.md` had no comparison classification at all. `build_questions_for_targets` now always
keeps the summary question when `comparison_target` is given and truncates *targets* instead
(see its docstring); `DEFAULT_MAX_ASKS` is raised to 10; and `ask_output.json` gains
`dropped_targets`/`comparison_page`/`comparison_context_chars` so a run like that one is
diagnosable without reading stderr.
